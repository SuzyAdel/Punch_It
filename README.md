# Punch_It
SphereChase-Punch is a Unity ML-Agents environment where a learning agent, locate a randomly placed sphere, and physically interact with it using a controlled punch or collision. The objective is to train the agent to approach the target efficiently and apply force from the correct range and angle.

# Key features include:

🔄 Randomized target placement on each episode reset

🧍‍♂️ Physics-based humanoid punch animation 

👊 Reward signal for successful contact with the sphere

⛔ Penalties for missing, standing idle, or leaving bounds

//🧠 Custom observations: vector direction, distance to target, velocity, and orientation

//🧪 A minimal testbed for movement, targeting, and physical interaction learning

This environment is ideal for exploring basic navigation, target acquisition, and reinforcement learning-driven interactions in Unity using ML-Agents.


# Steps
